                    <p>The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE didn't launch as expected in 2021 - with some suggesting it will launch early in 2022 on 4 January - prior to the launch of the Galaxy S22. You can expect it to offer value for money and prove to be a popular model, with a 6.4-inch display and a camera system the same as the Galaxy S21+.</p>
